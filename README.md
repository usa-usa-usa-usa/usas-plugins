## Overview

# Pushcut Notifications for RuneLite

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Pushcut is currently only available on iOS devices. This plugin will not work with Android unless Pushcut adds support in the future.

This RuneLite plugin allows you to forward in-game notifications to your iOS devices using [Pushcut](https://www.pushcut.io). Pushcut goes beyond simple alerts by enabling **actionable iOS notifications** that can trigger Shortcuts ‚Äî streamlining your ability to respond to RuneLite events while away from your desk.

This is particularly useful for players who use **remote desktop apps** to manage their gameplay from a distance. Whether you're monitoring idle status, tracking logout timers, or just staying aware of chat messages, this plugin enhances your ability to stay connected to your session in a meaningful and timely way.:

## Why Pushcut?

Compared to traditional notification plugins, Pushcut offers:

- ‚ú® **Shortcut integration**: Launch remote desktop apps, open widgets, or run custom Shortcuts directly from the notification.
- üîÅ **Fast response flow**: Immediately act on a notification without fumbling through app drawers.
- üîî **Reliable delivery**: Receive critical game notifications even when you're multitasking or the RuneLite client is minimized on your host machine.

## Example Use Case

Let‚Äôs say you're using **Chrome Remote Desktop** to check in on your RuneLite session while away from home.

You might configure a chat notification like:

> `"The gemstone crab burrows away"`

When that event is detected, this plugin sends a notification to your iPhone via Pushcut. You can customize the Pushcut notification to include an **action button** that launches your remote desktop app instantly ‚Äî no need to manually switch apps or search for it.

This improves your ability to quickly respond to in-game events ‚Äî especially in edge cases where the OSRS mobile client can‚Äôt run reliably in the background (e.g., iOS memory management).
